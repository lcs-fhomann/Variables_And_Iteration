 ## For-In Loops
 ### Basic For-In Loops
 You use the *for-in* loop to iterate over ranges of numbers.
 
 Here is a simple loop that changes a variable's value four times.
 
 First, the variable contains a 1. Then a 2. Then a 3. And so on...
 */
for value in 1...4 {
    print(value)
}

/*:
 ### Skipping values in a range
 The *stride* function can be combined with a *for-in* loop to move through a range of numbers, while also skipping some values.
 
 This is a *very powerful* concept *(hint, hint)*.
 
 For example, here how to use this type of loop to create a ladder image.
 */
// Create canvas
let canvas = Canvas(width: 300, height: 400)

// Line width
canvas.defaultLineWidth = 5

// Draw the "rungs" of a ladder
for y in stride(from: 0, through: 400, by: 50) {
     
    y
    
    // Draw each rung
    canvas.drawLine(fromX: 100, fromY: y, toX: 200, toY: y)
    
    canvas
    
}
/*:
 ### Counting backwards
 You can use a *for-in* loop with the *stride* function to count backwards as well.
 */
// Countdown, then blast off
print("=====")
print("Countdown begins...")
for value in stride(from: 10, through: 0, by: -1) {
    print(value)
}
print("Blast off!")
